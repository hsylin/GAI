# Computer Organization Assignments

This repository contains all the assignments I have completed for the **Fundamentals and Applications of Generative AI** course. Below is a brief overview of each assignment. You can find more details in the corresponding PDF files, and the code in each directory.

## 1. Arithmetic Text Generation
- **Objective**: Developed arithmetic text generation using RNN, GRU, and LSTM models, focusing on the effects of hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate) and training data distribution on model performance.
- **Assignment Details**: [Assignment Requirements](https://github.com/hsylin/GAI/blob/main/C14096073_GAI_Project2a/GAI_Project2a_requirment.pdf)  [Report](https://github.com/hsylin/GAI/blob/main/C14096073_GAI_Project2a/GAI_Project2a_report.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `C14096073_GAI_Project2a` directory.

## 2. Text Summarization
- **Objective**:  Implemented text summarization using T5 and GPT2 on a Chinese dataset, focusing on data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and performance evaluation with ROUGE metrics, and compared the performance of T5 and GPT2 on text summarization tasks.
- **Assignment Details**: [Assignment Requirements](https://github.com/hsylin/GAI/blob/main/C14096073_GAI_Project2b/GAI_Project2b_requirment.pdf) [Report](https://github.com/hsylin/GAI/blob/main/C14096073_GAI_Project2b/GAI_Project2b_report.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `C14096073_GAI_Project2b` directory.

## 3. PEFT on GLUE Benchmarks
- **Objective**:  Fine-tuned the BERT-base-uncased model on MRPC and SST-2 datasets, comparing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Bitfit and LoRA to assess differences in model performance and efficiency.
- **Assignment Details**: [Assignment Requirements]( https://github.com/hsylin/GAI/blob/main/C14096073_GAI_Project3/GAI_Project3_requirment.pdf)   [Report](https://github.com/hsylin/GAI/blob/main/C14096073_GAI_Project3/GAI_Project3_report.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `C14096073_GAI_Project3` directory.

## 4. DDPM-DIP-Image-Generation
- **Objective**: Integrated Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) with Deep Image Prior (DIP) to improve image generation quality. The project includes experiments comparing standalone models with the combined approach, highlighting advancements in both image quality and generation speed.
- **Assignment Details**: [Assignment Requirements](https://github.com/hsylin/GAI/blob/main/C14096073_GAI_Project4/requirement.pdf)     [Report](https://github.com/hsylin/GAI/blob/main/C14096073_GAI_Project4/report.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `C14096073_GAI_Project4` directory.

# Course Assignments: DDPM-DIP Integration for Image Generation

[Assignment Requirements PDF](https://github.com/hsylin/DDPM-DIP-Fusion/blob/main/requirement.pdf)

## Environment

- OS: Windows 10
- Python Version: 3.8

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hsylin/DDPM-DIP-Image-Generation.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Train the DDPM on MNIST:
```bash
$ python train_mnist.py
```
4. Execute the DIP training and the DDPM reverse process:
```bash
$ python main.py
```
## Result
You will obtain two images: one generated by DDPM+DIP (ddpm_dip.png) and another by DDPM alone (ddpm_nodip.png).
