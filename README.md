# Course Assignments: DDPM-DIP Integration for Image Generation

[Assignment Requirements PDF](https://github.com/hsylin/DDPM-DIP-Fusion/blob/main/requirement.pdf)

## Environment

- OS: Windows 10
- Python Version: 3.8

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hsylin/DDPM-DIP-Image-Generation.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Train the DDPM on MNIST:
```bash
$ python train_mnist.py
```
4. Execute the DIP training and the DDPM reverse process:
```bash
$ python main.py
```
## Result
You will obtain two images: one generated by DDPM+DIP (ddpm_dip.png) and another by DDPM alone (ddpm_nodip.png).
